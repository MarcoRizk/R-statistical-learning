# R-statistical-learning
A compilation of 9 R Scripts to implement different Statistical Learning methods including:
- Simple and Multiple Linear Regression
- Classification (Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbour
- Cross Validation and Bootstrapping
- Predictors subset selection methods
- Non Linear Modelling
- Decesion Trees and Forest Algorithms
- Support Vector Machines
- Unsupervised Learning

*Note*
The scripts use different already existing R packages
